Today we re-wired our base on Murphy so that our ping sensors are nice and clean.
We replaced our small breadboard with a larger one it will be less crowded.

We started looking into using the Jetson GPIO pins for the ping sensors and motor driver.
We concluded that while it is possible to use the Jetson pins for this, it would be a right
pain in the butt. 

We decided that we will use a Raspberry Pi instead of the Arduino for controlling motor driver
and the ping sensors. We did this because the Pi's GPIO is easier to use than the Jetson's, it's
faster processesor will let us use the encoder features on the motors so we can be more precise in movement,
and we can use Python libraries to more easily interface with these features. 

Our next steps will be to write code on the Pi to replace our Arudino, and to make additional 
platforms that we can mount to Murphy so that we can start messing with the camera and the echo. 

At the end of this lab session we found that something has been mis-wired or broken on Murphy. 
We suspect this to be a problem with how the power has been connected. We plan to meet on Friday for
a couple of hours in the lab to solve this problem so Mark can get started translating our motion code
from the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi.
